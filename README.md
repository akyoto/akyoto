# Hi 👋

I'm Eduard Urbach and I create high-performance software solutions.
I've been more than 20 years in this industry, where efficiency has often been overlooked.
I'm now dedicating my efforts to addressing this issue by using energy-efficient algorithms.

My main project is the [🌱 q](https://git.urbach.dev/cli/q) programming language, whose compiler is 6-8 times faster than typical implementations while occupying less than 1% of LLVM's code size.

While several features are still needed for production readiness, their performance impact is manageable.
I estimate that even after achieving feature parity, the compiler will remain at least 5-6 times faster than others.
I'm looking for contributors who want to design a correct, maintainable and high-performance compiler for the future.

As a side project I maintain a minimalistic HTTP [🌐 server](https://git.urbach.dev/go/web)
and [🔗 router](https://git.urbach.dev/go/router), both of which run on my website.
Their performance is exceptional, though certain compromises were necessary to achieve this level of efficiency.

Other things I've worked on are
a [📃 markdown](https://git.urbach.dev/go/markdown) renderer,
a [🌈 color](https://git.urbach.dev/go/color) module and
an [🚦 assert](https://git.urbach.dev/go/assert) package for testing.
While all of these are still actively maintained, they naturally receive less attention than my main projects.

I'm available for hire. Feel free to [contact](https://urbach.dev/contact) me if you'd like to get in touch.
