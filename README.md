# Hi 👋

I'm Eduard Urbach and I create high-performance software solutions.
I've been more than 20 years in this industry that stopped caring about efficiency and it's about time we clean up this mess we left behind and start to use energy efficient algorithms.

My main project is the [🌱 q](https://git.urbach.dev/cli/q) programming language whose compiler is 6-8 times faster than your usual implementations and its size is less than 1% of LLVM's code base.

There are still a lot of features that need to be implemented to be production ready,
but the performance impact that these will have is within manageable limits.
My estimate is that the compiler will still be at least 5-6 times faster than other compilers once feature parity has been reached.

As a side project I maintain a minimalistic HTTP [🌐 server](https://git.urbach.dev/go/web)
and [🔗 router](https://git.urbach.dev/go/router) which run on my website.
The performance of these is top-notch, but sacrifices had to be made in spec compliance.
This is usually not a problem because they are designed to run behind a reverse proxy.

Other things I've worked on are
a [📃 markdown](https://git.urbach.dev/go/markdown) renderer,
a [🌈 color](https://git.urbach.dev/go/color) module and
an [🚦 assert](https://git.urbach.dev/go/assert) package for testing.
All of these are still actively maintained but naturally they don't get the same attention as my main projects.

You are free to use my software as long as you follow the [license](https://urbach.dev/license) conditions.

I'm available for hire. Feel free to [contact](https://urbach.dev/contact) me if you'd like to get in touch.
